I just created Empty Remote Repository from GitHub.com account by clicking on the plus icon on the top right corner and new repository
and give a name and click create

And Cloned this repository by clicking on Set up in Desktop and (Optionally select the location) click on clone

It Cloned remote repo to local computer so we can start working locally
